# Introduction (i)

## What is Machine Learning?

### Machine Learning = How to compute coefficients

## Types of Machine Learning

- Based on output
  - Regression, Classification, Clustering, Embedding
- Based on data
  - Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised, Reinforcement Learning
- Based on models

  - Generative, Discriminative

- Supervised Learning
  - Classification
    - Data to discrete class label
    - Predict a class label
  - Regression
    - Predict a numeric value
  - Similarity
    - Find similar/dissimilar data
- Unsupervised Learning
  - Clustering
    - Discover structure in data
  - Embedding
    - Data to vector
- Reinforcement Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
    - Train by feedback
